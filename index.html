                  Anthony "Tony" Stark is a genius inventor and billionaire
                  industrialist, who suits up in his armor of cutting-edge
                  technology to become the super hero Iron Man. The adopted son
                  of weapons manufacturer Howard Stark, Tony inherited his
                  family's company at a young age following his parents' death.
                  While overseeing a manufacturing plant in a foreign country,
                  Stark was kidnapped by local terrorists. Instead of giving in
                  to his captors' demands to build weapons for them, Stark
                  created a powerful suit of armor for himself to escape.
                  Returning to America, Stark further upgraded the armor and put
                  his vast resources and intellect to use for the betterment of
                  the world as Iron Man.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tony kept his alter-ego a secret for most of his career,
                  juggling his responsibilities as head of Stark Industries
                  while becoming a key player in the superhuman community as
                  Iron Man, founding the world's premier super hero team, the
                  Avengers. Over the years, Stark has faced numerous enemies,
                  such as the Mandarin, Justin Hammer, Iron Monger and the
                  Titanium Man, as well as many personal demons, most notably
                  his addiction to alcohol, which once caused Tony to step down
                  from superheroics, with his confidant Jim Rhodes becoming Iron
                  Man on that occasion. For many years, Tony covered his secret
                  identity claiming that Iron Man was his anonymous bodyguard.
                  After briefly outing himself as Iron Man, Tony made his
                  identity a secret again by claiming to have enlisted a new
                  pilot for the armor. However, he returned his identity to the
                  public light once and for all at the beginning of the
                  superhuman civil war.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recently, Tony escaped death by reconfiguring his body with a
                  digital back-up of his mind, inadvertently causing him to
                  become temporarily convinced that he was a clone of the real,
                  late Tony Stark. This resulted in Tony leading an army of
                  artificial-life forms in a war against the anti-A.I. campaign
                  of his adoptive brother Arno. After coming around the fact
                  that he was the real Tony Stark all along and once he stopped
                  Arno's deranged plan to enslave humanity to stop a
                  non-existent alien threat, Tony opted to embark on a journey
                  of self-discovery to escape the baggage of his career.
                  Stepping away from his high-tech lifestyle, Tony finds himself
                  returning to his roots in an attempt to put back the "man" in
                  Iron Man.

                  Dr. Bruce Banner, Ph.D aka the Hulk is an American theoretical
                  physicist, famed for his work into the studies of nuclear
                  physics and gamma radiation. He was recruited by General
                  Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross and the US Army to develop the
                  first Gamma Bomb. During its first live test he was bombarded
                  with a massive dose of gamma rays while saving Rick Jones, a
                  kid who was out on the test site. He was mutated into a green
                  behemoth, the living personification of rage, fueled by pure
                  physical strength and would come to be known as nearly
                  mindless "Incredible Hulk". Fearful of the damage that Hulk
                  could inflict, as well as fleeing from the military, he went
                  on the run. He later found a home among the Avengers, the

                  Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which
                  helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the
                  mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. When his irresponsible
                  and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to
                  Midgard (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal
                  medical student named Donald Blake, stripped of his memory.
                  After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his
                  godly powers. Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as
                  well as one of the founding members of the Avengers; "Earth's
                  Mightiest Heroes".

            The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either
            superpowers or other special characteristics. Its purpose was to
            protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though primarily affiliated with the United States of America, they
            worked with the peaceful interests of the whole world in mind rather
            than a specific country or organization. The Avengers were first
            assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri
            army to conquer the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team, consisting of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black
            Widow, Hawkeye and Hulk, defeated Loki and went their separate ways
            for a while.
